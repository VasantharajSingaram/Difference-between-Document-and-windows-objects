Document Object:
--> Document objects represent web pages loaded in browsers. 
--> We can access an HTML element by accessing the document object.
--> Document objects allow us to add dynamic content to our web pages.
--> There are two ways to access the document object: by the window.document or by using the name document alone.
--> Syntax: document.property_name;
Example: getElementById():
It returns the object of the given ID. If no object with that ID exists then it returns null.


Window Object:
--> Window objects are at the top of the DOM hierarchy.
--> It displays the contents of a webpage in a browser window or frame.
--> Global objects, functions, and variables of Javascript are members of the window object.
--> Window objects are created whenever a window appears on screen to display the document's contents.
--> Syntax: window.property_name;
Example: alert():
It used to display an alert box. It displays a specified message along with an OK button and is generally used to make sure that the information comes through the user.
